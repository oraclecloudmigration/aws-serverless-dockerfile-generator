## Dockerfile Serverless Generator

### Description

The purpose is to generate a new docker image whenever there are official new releases to **terraform** (automatically), **packer**, **ansible**, or other cloud management tools contained.

Dockerfile's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/oraclecloudmigration/cloud-tools) and is used by a [Docker automated build](https://hub.docker.com/r/oraclecloudmigration/cloud-tools/) constructing an image with handy cloud management tools (i.e. ```terraform, packer, ansible```).

```
# CWD into terraform directory and

# Initialize terraform project
